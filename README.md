**YaFileSqueezer** is a unique file archiver designed for research and
experimentation with different compression algorithms. Unlike other archiving
tools, YaFileSqueezer provides users with the ability to manually adjust
parameters such as sliding window size and character length to see how they
impact compression quality. Additionally, the tool offers a real-time
visualization of compression operations, providing users with a better
understanding of how different algorithms work. While file compression is a
primary feature, YaFileSqueezer's main goal is to provide a platform for
experimentation and learning about compression algorithms, making it an ideal
tool for researchers and students in the field.
